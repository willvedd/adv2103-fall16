				<li><b>Valid HTML Document</b> - Validate your HTML document with an <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a>. Correct any significant warnings and issues.</li>
				<li><b>At least fifteen different CSS properties</b> - Remember the simple ones: font-size, margin, padding, text-align, color, background-color etc. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">View a comprehensive list of CSS properties</a>.</li>
				<li><b>Project hosted on your github page</b></li>
				<li><b>At least two external files</b> - Files could be anything, images, videos, mp3s, pdfs, word documents. Integrated it into your project through any means necessary. So long as they're used in your project in some capacity.</li>

			<h2>Final Project</h2>
			<p>Scheduled for Dec 19 at 5:45pm.<s>Actual project exam or project to be determined.</s></p>
			<p>Students will work in groups to perform a comprehensive revamp of an existing company's (the "client") web strategy. Groups will be required to critically evaluate their client's existing web presence and devise a strategy to achieve the client's goals as well as a good experience for the end user.</p>
			<p>A successful final project will meet the following criteria:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>A high level content audit (10%)</b> - Groups will evaluate the existing content and information hieararchy of their client and recommend a revised version based off their goals. It is recommended that students be thorough but keep the approach high-level, meaning put more thought and emphasis on first and second level pages. Suggested submitted medium is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sitemap&biw=1439&bih=799&site=imghp&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwje2NS1manQAhWh14MKHWl0BvIQ_AUIBygC">sitemap</a> or spreadsheet.</li>
				<li><b>Roadmap/Brainstorming Exercise (10%)</b> - Similarly to week 11, groups will need to critically evaluate the goals and user personas to devise their strategy going forard. It is important to be very critical at this stage while mistakes and deviations are still easy to correct. Recreating the post-it note exercise is encouraged but other mediums also acceptable, so long as there is evidence of collaborative thought.</li>
				<li><b>Wireframes of at least three critical pages (25%)</b> - Gropus will create at least three (3) wireframes of critical pages. Wireframes should be constructed based off the client's goals and good UX and usability practices. Groups may submit wireframes of any dimension they think is most approrpriate for conveying the strategy. For example, if a client is looking to improve mobile strategy, it is recommended to submit a mobile wireframe.</li>
				<li><b>Prototype two critical web pages (40%)</b> - Groups will use their knowledge of HTML and CSS to develop semi-functioning prototypes of their wireframes. Prototypes are expected to meet all the criteria proposed in the midterm. Prototypes should be high-quality in terms of their design and execution but do not need to function properly. For example, if your client needs a ecommerce store, you don't need to actually build the functionality out, simply a mockup of that interface.</li>
				<li><b>Prototypes hosted on the web (5%)</b> - Groups will host their content online by <i>any means necesary</i>. In order to receive credit for this portion, the prototypes will need to be accessed by a public URL.</li>
				<li><b>Writeup (10%)</b> - Groups will need to submit a 1500 word writeup explaining their process, challenges and defend their strategy from possible criticism. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Details</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Groups may have up to four (4) members</li>
				<li>Groups will be assigned a client unless requested and approved by the instructor.</li>
				<li>Submissions due by December 19 at 5:45pm</li>
				<li>Groups may use any software or tools at their disposal including content managements systems, frontend frameworks, design-oriented software.</li>
				<li>Early submissions will recieve a 1% per day (24hr) bonus up to 7%</li>
